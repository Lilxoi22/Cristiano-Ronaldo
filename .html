Ronaldo won his first trophy in England, the 2003-04 FA Cup, in May 2004, when Manchester United beat Millwall 3-0. Ronaldo scored the first goal of the match.[28]

Ronaldo scored his first UEFA Champions League goals in a 7-1 victory against A.S. Roma in April 2007. He scored two goals that day in what was his 30th Champions League match.[29] He played the FA Cup Final that year, but United lost 1-0 to Chelsea.[30] Even though he lost the FA Cup final, he didn't end the season without a title, because he won his first Premier League title.[31]   <br>

In the 2007-08 season, Ronaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for Manchester United in a 6â€“0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008.[32] In the 2008 Champions League final against Chelsea, he scored a header as the match ended 1-1 after extra time. Although he missed his penalty, Manchester United won the shootout 6-5 and Ronaldo won his first UEFA Champions League.[33] On 15 November 2008, Ronaldo scored his 100th goal for United in a 5-0 win against Stoke City. He also scored two free-kicks: the first one was his 100th goal.[34] He scored a total of 42 goals and won the European Golden Boot, an award given to the top scorer of every European national league. <br>

He won the first FIFA Puskas Award in 2009. The Puskas Award is given to whoever scores the best goal of that year. The goal was a 40-yard strike into the top-left corner against FC Porto on 15 April 2009 in the Champions League quarter finals. That goal was the only goal of the game. It was also an important goal because it sent United to the semi-finals.[35] In the semi-final against Arsenal, Ronaldo scored two goals. One of them was a free kick from 40 yards out. His goals helped Man United qualify to the final, where they lost to Barcelona 2-0.
